  - title: American Blues
    description: This track struts in with a grin, juggling guitar licks like hotdogs on a grill. It’s the kind of blues that makes your toes tap while your burger flips itself — cheerful, twangy, and impossible not to dance to with a soda in hand.

  - title: Borderline Blues
    description:  This tune shuffles in like a bluesman who’s had one too many espressos. The guitar noodles like it’s late for work, the groove keeps tripping over itself in a charming way, and the whole track feels like a Monday morning that accidentally turned into a dance party.

    description: This blues track drips with rhythm like raindrops on a tin roof. The guitar sloshes through puddles with a grin, while the groove holds an umbrella that keeps flipping inside out. It’s the perfect soundtrack for dancing in soggy socks.
